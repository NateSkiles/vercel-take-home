# 10. Exercise Feedback

How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise?

## Feedback

I enjoyed this exercise, which was one of the most engaging I have completed.

I have used Vercel to deploy some of my personal projects before, but it was nice to take some time and explore concepts I had not previously explored.

The exercise was well structured, and the time frame was reasonable, though I spent more than three hours on it, going down some rabbit holes when I could have been more focused on the task.

If I were to improve anything, I suggest exploring some of the more advanced features of Vercel, such as serverless functions or edge configuration. While the exercises touched on these concepts, it could have been enlightening to have implemented them in some way within this project. This would be an excellent way to test the candidate's ability to learn and apply new concepts to a real-world scenario.
