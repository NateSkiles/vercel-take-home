# 1. Support Tasks

From this [list](https://gist.github.com/Pieparker/b04a4e9ff82ba949e5db9d5b0e9d89e8), rank your 5 most favorite and 5 least favorite support tasks. Provide a brief explanation for each.

## Most favorite

### 1. Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project

I can think of nothing more satisfying than banging my head against a problem, only to finally find that one log that explains everything. I might be addicted to that feeling after identifying the cause of a break and sharing the "aha" moment with a customer.

### 2. Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub

Resolving the issue would be a close second to the above. I love the idea of making meaningful contributions to the product and doing so in a visible way to the community or other teams.

### 3. Act as a dedicated CSE for a handful of key customers to ensure their success using Vercel

One of the highlights of my TSE position was being the primary point of contact for important clients. Establishing meaningful relationships with customers and aiding them in achieving success was a fulfilling experience.

### 4. Help train and onboard new support teammates

In almost every job I've had (tech or otherwise), sharing knowledge gained the hard way and helping new teammates navigate their new roles has always been a rewarding experience.

### 5. Work with people to figure out if Vercel is suitable for their use case

I like this type of task because it requires a deep understanding of the product. It's great motivation to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest features and use cases.

## Least favorite

### 1. Help resolve billing issues for customers

While undoubtedly important, the billing cases I've worked on have typically been hand-offs to the billing department or simple explanations of the specifics of certain plansâ€”not what I would consider the most engaging work.

### 2. Manage a support team

I could see myself growing into a managerial role, but now I'm more interested in the technical aspects of the job.

### 3. Scheduling time-off coverage and collaborating as part of a growing cohesive support team

Similar to the above, I'm not particularly interested in the administrative aspects of managing a team at this time. However, I am always eager to collaborate with teammates and contribute to a positive team culture.

### 4. Find and recruit teammates for the support team

While ranking these tasks, I noticed that all the administrative tasks trend toward the bottom, though this one is less so. I like the idea that team members would be involved in the hiring process, given that they generally understand what the team needs.

### 5. Respond to 50+ support requests via email every day

I can handle a high volume of requests, having averaged in the top 1-3 cases resolved per month in my previous role. Especially when hitting a stride, I can be quite productive. However, I prefer focusing on more complex cases or projects to improve the product or team.
