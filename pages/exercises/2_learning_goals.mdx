# 2. Learning Goals

What do you want to learn or do more of at work?

### Caching

I have a textbook understanding of caching and have used technologies like Redis in the past, but I'd like to learn more about how caching is implemented in practice and used to improve performance at scale.

### CI/CD

Again, I have experience working with CI/CD on personal projects, but I'd like to understand industry best practices better.

### Testing

I want more experience writing effective tests and using testing to improve the quality of my code.
