### Thoughts

Reading the customer's request, they don't give much context regarding the configuration of their project. Assuming they are using Next.js, I recommend a static redirect, as they haven't indicated that they need to redirect based on any request-specific data.

However, I've also included a dynamic redirect example in case they need to redirect based on request data. I've recommended an edge function, which will run at the edge closest to the user, resulting in faster redirects.

> If your redirect URL is not dependent on runtime or request-specific data, a **static redirect** would be the simplest way to implement your redirect. You can read more on static redirects here: [Docs](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/redirects#static-redirects)

```js filename="next.config.js" copy showLineNumbers
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/blog",
        destination: "https://example.com",
        permanent: true,
      },
    ];
  },
};
```
