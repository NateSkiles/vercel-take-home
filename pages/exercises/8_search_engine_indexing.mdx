### Thoughts

Looking through the Vercel documentation, I found that preview deployments include an `X-Robots-Tag` header set to `noindex` to prevent preview builds from affecting production SEO ([docs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments#search-engine-indexing)).

Additionally, I found that you can add headers to a Vercel deployment by adding a `vercel.json` file to the root of the project ([docs](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#headers)).

With this in mind, the user should be able to add the `X-Robots-Tag` header to their production deployment to prevent search engines from indexing their site.

```json filename="vercel.json" copy showLineNumbers

  // ...
  "headers": [
    {
      // source matches all file paths
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          // X-Robots-Tag header set to noindex tells search engines not to index the site
          "key": "X-Robots-Tag",
          "value": "noindex"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
