# 9. Common Issues

What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?

## Answer

### Common Problems

It is possible that Vercel customers face deployment issues, such as build errors or difficulty with CI/CD pipelines. SSL certificate, domain management, and DNS configuration may also pose challenges for customers. These tasks can sometimes be complicated or easily forgotten after initial setup.

It is also likely that customers experience difficulties with Vercel's serverless and edge functions. Users may miss certain steps during configuration or have trouble debugging their functions.

### Solutions

In the short term, any issues that occur during deployment can be fixed by addressing build errors and providing the user with clear guidance on how to resolve them. For the long term, it is important to offer customers detailed documentation and information that can help them understand the root causes of these issues. By doing so, they will be better equipped to handle similar problems on their own in the future, without needing to seek additional support.

During the process of troubleshooting customer issues, it can be beneficial to provide them with best practices and tips to avoid potential scaling or performance issues. However, it is important to avoid overwhelming them with too much information, as this can lead to frustration when trying to solve a more straightforward problem.
