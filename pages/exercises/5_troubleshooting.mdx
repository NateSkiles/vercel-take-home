# 5. Troubleshooting

Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a build issue on a framework or technology that you've not seen before. How would you begin troubleshooting this and what questions would you ask the customer to understand the situation better?

## Process

I would start my troubleshooting process by asking clarifying questions to point me in the correct direction, ensuring I understand the issue the user is running into, even if I don't understand the underlying technology.

### Clarifying Questions

I would ask or have the user clarify the following:

- The exact error message they are seeing
- Have them explain what they are trying to accomplish
- Verify the exact changes the user made since the last time the build was successful
- The version of the framework or technology they are using
- Walk back the steps they took to see if they missed anything

### Next Steps

Once I've confirmed I have a clear and concise understanding of the issue and the user's environment, I would start researching the error message and the technology they are using. I would look at the technology's documentation and see if any known issues or common problems could be causing the error message. I would also look at forums and other resources to see if others have encountered similar issues and how they resolved them.

If the above does not turn up any resolutions, I would start reaching out to teammates who know more about this specific technology. If no team member has a working knowledge of the particular technology, I would find someone free to sync and walk through the issue as I know it. I've found that walking through an issue with a third party often reveals facts I might have missed the first time around.
