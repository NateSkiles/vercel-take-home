# 9. Common Issues

What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?

## Answer

### Common Problems

Vercel customers likely face deployment issues, such as build errors or difficulty with CI/CD pipelines. SSL certificate, domain management, and DNS configuration may also pose challenges. These tasks can sometimes be complicated or easily forgotten after initial setup.

Customers will also likely need assistance with Vercel's serverless and edge functions. Users may miss specific steps during configuration or have trouble debugging their functions.

### Solutions

In the short term, any issues during deployment can be fixed by addressing build errors and providing the user with clear guidance on resolving them. In the long term, it is essential to offer customers detailed documentation and information to help them understand these issues' root causes. By doing so, they will be better equipped to handle similar problems on their own without needing additional support.

During troubleshooting customer issues, it can be beneficial to provide them with best practices and tips to avoid potential scaling or performance issues. However, it is important not to overwhelm them with too much information, as this can lead to frustration when trying to solve a more straightforward problem.
